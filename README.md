# Summary

TWITTIRÒ-UD is a collection of Italian tweets annotated in Universal Dependencies that can be exploited for the training of NLP systems to enhance their performance on social media texts.


# Introduction

TWITTIRÒ-UD has been created by enriching the dataset used for the IronITA 2018 task of Irony Detection in Italian Tweets (see Cignarella 2018).

The original corpus consists of 1,424 tweets (28,387 tokens). The syntactic annotation process was carried out through alternating steps of automatic scripting and manual revision, and finally with some out-of-domain parsing experiments. Parsing results also underwent a manual revision by two independent annotators.
 
In order to meet the requirements of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), entered into force on May 2018, the resource content has been pseudonymized, by substituting original tweet IDs and user names.



# Corpus splitting

The treebank has been randomly split as follows:
* it_twittiro-ud-train.conllu: 1,138 tweets
* it_twittiro-ud-dev.conllu: 144 tweets 
* it_twittiro-ud-test.conllu: 142 tweets



# Basic statistics

Word count:  29,605
Token count: 28,387
Dep. relations: 54 of which 19 language specific
POS tags: 16
Category=value feature pairs: 42
